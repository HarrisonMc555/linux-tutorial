Terminal Tips
=============

This file contains tips about using the actual terminal. This doesn't contain
any (real) commands, but will help you use commands more quickly and easily.


Tab Completion
==============

When you are typing a command an the command line, the terminal will pay
attention to what you have typed so far, and if you hit the Tab button, will
attempt to complete what you were typing.

This is typically used when typing in file and directory names. If your current
directory looked like this:

- Documents/
- Downloads/
- Pictures/
- Videos/
- misc/
- README.txt
- essay.doc

Then typing in "Pic", then hitting Tab, would complete your current entry into
"Pictures/". If you typed "es", then Tab, it would expand into "essays.doc". If
you typed "D", then tab, it would complete to "Do" and then beep at you (or
flash the screen or something). This is to signify that there are multiple valid
completions of your entry. Hitting Tab again (maybe twice) will print out the
options for valid completions to jog your memory.


History
=======

Most terminals will keep a history of the commands you've executed. If you want
to repeat a command, simply press the Up arrow. If you want to continue cycling
through your previous commands, you can keep pressing Up (and Down to get more
recent commands).

In addition, if you type "!" followed by any other characters, the terminal will
execute the most recent command that started with the characters that you typed
in.


Man Pages
=========

Techincally this is a command, but it helps you find your way around. If you
type "man" followed by the name of a command (e.g. ls, cd, man, etc.), it will
pull up a screen of information about that command. You can press '?' to see
help on how to navigate, but the most important things to know are 'j' to move
down, 'k' to move up, and 'q' to quit.
