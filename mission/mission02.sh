# <num3> <filename3>

# EXAMPLE:

# 13 mission01.sh
# 59 mission02.sh

# YOUR CODE HERE








# Hints below:

































# HINTS:

# Type 'wc --help' for help with the wc (word count) command.

# Figure out how to display just the number of lines in a 
# single file.

# To do this for all files, you will need to have a list 
# of all the files in the directory. You will then need 
# to use the command on every file.
