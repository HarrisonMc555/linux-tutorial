# MISSION03: ALL YOUR WORDS BELONG TO US

# Your task is to count ALL of the words in ALL of the files in the current 
# directory.

# Your output should simply be a number.

# <number of words>


# YOUR CODE HERE








# Hints below:
















































# You'll need to learn how to save variables and add variables.

# X=$(command) will store the result of command into the variable "X".

# The wc command is your friend. type 'wc --help' for help.

# Awk is probably the easiest way to parse information separated by 
# whitespace.

# To add variables, use the syntax $((expression)), such as: 
# $((VAR+2))

# To save it, you can use the same syntax as normal: 
# VAR2=$((VAR1+2))
