MISSION README

This is an opportunity for you to practice your new shell scripting 
skills.

In this directory, you will find files named mission##.sh. These 
are your mission files. They will contain instructions on what 
you must do to complete each mission.

In each file, you will find a comment labeld "YOUR CODE HERE". You 
will place your code there (although actually it doesn't really 
matter where you put it).

You can run your file with the command "bash mission##.sh". You 
can look at the output (and any files it may have created) and 
see if it worked.

You can create some test cases for your script to work with by 
running "bash testcase##.sh" if one exists for that mission.

When you feel that you have successfully completed the mission, 
you can check your answer with the command "bash check.sh -m ##". 
This script will run your code alongside the solution code and 
test to make sure they producded the same output. If something 
is different in any of the outputs or files that were created, 
it will display what each output/file contained for the 
solution and your code.

It is recommended that you make two copies of everything in 
this folder: one for your completed, successful missions, and 
one for the missions you are currently working on. That way, 
if one of your scripts accidentally deletes or overwrites 
files in your directory, you still have a backup.

Good luck! And have fun.
