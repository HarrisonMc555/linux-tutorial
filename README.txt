This is meant to be a tutorial to learn the UNIX command line (mac and linux), 
the basics of shell scripting (using bash), beginning SED and AWK, and some 
other various skills.

Start with finding a text editor to read and write your files in. You can use 
your Operating System's native text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.), but 
eventually you'll want to use an editor that highlights syntax for you.

Some good, free text editors are:
   -Emacs
   -Vi/Vim
   -Sublime Text
   -Notepad++
   -Gedit
   -Kate
   -etc.

There are many free options online, almost any will probably do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get started, go through the files in the directory "learn_bash". They will 
go through the basics of bash shell scripting. If they seem too basic for you, 
you can look at the headers for each file to see if the topics or commands 
each one covers is unfamiliar and only go through those.

After going through those, you can go through the files in the "learn_awk" or 
other tutorials (later to come) to learn other tools.

At any point, you can start to practice by experimenting with creating your 
own scripts or by trying out the "missions". In the "mission" directory, 
you'll find files that describe a particular "mission" you must perform. These 
are good opportunities to try to apply the skills you've learned in the 
tutorials.

If you are running Windows and don't have access to a Linux or Mac machine, 
there are some ways to get access to a UNIX command line. If you are a BYU 
Engineering or Computer Science student you can ssh into ssh.et.byu.edu or 
schizo.cs.byu.edu respectively. To do this, download PuTTY.exe from the 
internet. It's a free, lightweight ssh client for Windows. Simply type the 
address above, and when prompted provide your department id and password. You 
will log in to a UNIX environment in which you can try out all of the UNIX 
commands, run shell scripts, etc. The only downside is that to edit text, 
you'll either need to learn a command-line based editor (ie emacs or vim) 
or copy and paste all of your text into the PuTTY terminal (which can be done 
by right clicking the screen after copying text in your native editor).

A handy tool to use in connection with PuTTY is WinSCP. This proivdes a GUI 
to help you move files between your native computer and your accounty on 
the Engineering Department, CS Department, or any other external account.

An alternative would be to download either 1) A tool to connect to your 
department's linux account with a GUI session or 2) a virtual machine. 
Vmware is a professional tool that can be downloaded for free through BYU.

If you are running Linux or Mac, then simply make a folder and start the 
command line. On a mac you can do a spotlight search for "Terminal", and on 
Linux it's usually built in fairly well.
