File Content Commands
=====================

This file contains commands that work with file contents.


Command: cat
============

The name 'cat' is short for "concatenate". It simply prints the output of every
file it is given to its standard output, one after another (concatenated). You
don't have to specify more than one file; the most common usage is actually to
simply print the contents of one file to the standard output, either to view or
to pipe to another command.

Example:
$ cat file1.txt
This is the text in file1.txt
$ cat file2.txt
I live in file2.txt
This file has two lines
$ cat file1.txt file2.txt
This is the text in file1.txt
I live in file2.txt
This file has two lines


Command: less
=============

The name 'less' is derived from its predecessor, 'more'. You can use it to view
the contents of a file or the standard input. It provides a way to navigate a
long file, interactively search through its contents, and perform several other
actions. If there are any command line arguments it will display those files,
else it will display the standard input.

When you first use the 'less' command, you will notice that your entire terminal
is taken over by the command. It will no longer display the previous commands
and their outputs, but will only be displaying the contents of the file (or
standard input). There are few things you need to know about navigating in less.

  - Quitting: To quit, press 'q'.

  - Help: To get help on the 'less' command, press 'h'.

  - Moving: To move up and down a line at a time, press 'k' and 'j' (or <up> and
      <down>). respectively. To move forward and backward a whole window at a
      time, press 'f' and 'b'.  -

  - Searching: To interactively search through the contents, press '/' and type
      in the pattern to search for (it uses regular expressions). To cycle
      forward and backward through matches, press 'n' and 'N'.


Command: head
=============

The 'head' command is very similar to the cat command but only displays the
first 10 lines of a file. If you want to display more or fewer lines, you can
use the '-n' flag followed by the number of lines (with or without a space in
between). If you pass a negative number to the '-n' flag, it will display all
but the last n lines.

Example:
$ cat samplefile.txt
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
Line 11
Line 12
$ head samplefile.txt
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
$ head samplefile.txt -n 3
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
$ head samplefile.txt -n3
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
$ head samplefile.txt -n-4
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8


Command: tail
=============

The 'tail' command is very similar to the head command. By default, the tail
command prints the last 10 lines to the standard output. When given the '-n'
flag, it instead prints the last n lines. If you pass a positive number (you add
a leading '+' to the number) to the '-n' flag, it will display the file starting
at line n.

Example:
$ cat samplefile.txt
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
Line 11
Line 12
$ tail samplefile.txt
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
Line 11
Line 12
$ tail samplefile.txt -n3
Line 10
Line 11
Line 12
$ tail samplefile.txt -n+3
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
Line 11
Line 12
