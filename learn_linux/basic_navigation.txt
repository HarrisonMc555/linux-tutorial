Basic Navigation
================

This file contains things that you should know if you're just starting with
Linux. You should make sure you're comfortable with everything in here before
moving on to anything else.



Command: ls
===========

The name 'ls' is short for list. Running this command with no arguments (the
typical usage) will list all of the files in the current working directory. If
you run it with one or more arguments it will list the files in the directories
you pass as arguments.

Example:
$ ls
dir/  file1.txt  file2.txt  myscript.sh
$ ls dir
otherfile.txt


Command: cd
===========

The name 'cd' stands for "change directory". Running this command with no
parameters will move you (the working directory) to your home directory (~). If
you type a directory as a parameter, it will move you to that directory. You can
specify relative directories (just start typing in the directory that's in the
current location) or an absolute directory (start with a slash, '/', and type
everything from there). You can also 'cd' into a directory several layers deep,
i.e. a directory in a directory in a directory, etc.

Example:
$ cd ~
$ pwd
/home/username
$ cd Documents
$ pwd
/home/username/Documents
$ cd /etc
$ pwd
/etc
$ cd
/home/username


Command: mv
===========

The name 'mv' is short for "move". Running this command will move one file
(or directory) to another location. You can either give two file names, in which
case it will rename the first file to the name of the second, or you can specify
one or more files or directories followed lastly by a final directory, in which
case it will move all of the files into the last directory.

Example:
$ ls
dir/  file1.txt  file2.txt  myscript.sh
$ mv file1.txt newfile.txt
$ ls
dir/  file2.txt  myscript.sh  newfile.txt
$ mv file2.txt dir
$ ls
dir/  myscript.sh  newfile.txt
$ ls dir
otherfile.txt  file2.txt


Command: cp
===========

The name 'cp' is short for "copy". Run this command with two parameters: 1) the
file you want to copy, and 2) the name of the copied file.

Example:
$ cp newfile.txt copiedfile.txt
$ ls
copiedfile.txt  dir/  myscript.sh  newfile.txt
$ cat newfile.txt
This is the text in file1.txt
$ cat copiedfile.txt
This is the text in file1.txt

Command: mkdir
==============

The name 'mkdir' is short for "make directory". Running this command will
create a directory. By default it will be in the current directory.

Example:
$ mkdir newdir
$ ls
copiedfile.txt  dir/  myscript.sh  newdir/  newfile.txt


Command: rm and rmdir
=====================

The name 'rm' is short for "remove", and 'rmdir' is short for "remove
directory". The rm command will delete any file that you give it as a parameter.
**NOTE** This is not like deleting files on Windows or Mac, where the files are
sent to a Recycling bin or an equivalent location. In Unix-style Operating
Systems, such as Linux, it is extremely difficult or impossible to recover files
after you call 'rm' on them. The 'rmdir' is exactly the same but only will
remove *empty* directories (although there are options you can use to get around
this).

Example:
$ ls
copiedfile.txt  dir/  myscript.sh  newdir/  newfile.txt
$ rm copiedfile.txt
$ ls
dir/  myscript.sh  newdir/  newfile.txt


Command: pwd
============

The name 'pwd' is an acronym for "print working directory". Running this command
will print the full (absolute) path of the current working directory to the
terminal. You can use this if you're not sure where you are in the file system.

Example:
$ cd ~
$ pwd
/home/username
$ ls
bin  Documents  Pictures  Downloads  www
$ cd Documents
$ pwd
/home/username/Documents
$ cd /etc
$ pwd
/etc


Command: exit
=============

Running this command will end the current session of whatever you are doing. If
you type it directly at the command line, it will exit that session, and you wil
need to open another one to continue working. If you are using ssh, it will 
close that session with the remote host and you will have to restart the
connection to continue using it. You can press Ctrl-D to send an "End of File"
(EOF) character to perform the exit command.
